=== Hand 1 ===
With a Queen of Clubs and a Trey of Clubs in my hand, I have a decent starting hand, especially considering the potential for a flush. Additionally, the pot is small and I only need to invest a minimal amount to raise. By raising to the minimum, I can build the pot while also applying pressure on my opponent, which could potentially lead to a more favorable situation as the hand progresses.

Stacks: P0=398, P1=396
With an Ace and a Four of Hearts in hand, I have a suited connector that has potential for both a flush and a straight. The pot is already built up to 6, and with only a small amount to call, raising to 6 will allow me to take control of the 
hand while also making it more difficult for my opponent to continue without a strong hand. This play maximizes my expected value given the current situation.

Stacks: P0=394, P1=396
With a hand of Queen of Clubs and Trey of Clubs, I have a decent starting hand, especially with the potential for a flush draw. Given that the pot is currently at 10 and I have the opportunity to raise to the minimum of 8, it makes sense to apply pressure and build the pot. Raising also allows me to take control of the hand and possibly eliminate opponents with weaker hands.

Stacks: P0=394, P1=392
With an Ace-high hand and a suited four, I have a decent starting hand that can potentially improve on later streets. Raising to the minimum of 10 allows me to take control of the pot and potentially force opponents with weaker hands to fold, increasing my chance of winning the pot. Additionally, with stacks being relatively shallow, this is a good opportunity 
to build the pot while still maintaining a healthy stack.

Stacks: P0=390, P1=392
With a hand of Qc and 3c, I have a decent starting hand, especially with the potential for flush draws given they're both clubs. Raising to 12 will allow me to increase the pot and potentially apply pressure on my opponent, while still keeping my stack intact. This is a good opportunity to take the lead in the hand.
Action: CompletionBettingOrRaisingTo(commentary=None, player_index=1, amount=12)
Stacks: P0=390, P1=388
With an Ace and a Four of Hearts, I have a decent starting hand, especially since it can potentially make a flush if hearts come on the board. Raising to the minimum of 14 puts pressure on my opponent and allows me to take control of the pot 
early. Given the current pot size and my stack, this is a strategic move that could maximize my expected value.
Action: CompletionBettingOrRaisingTo(commentary=None, player_index=0, amount=14)
Stacks: P0=386, P1=388
Raising to 16 is a good move here because I have a suited connector (Qc and 3c) that can potentially form a strong hand if the flop brings favorable cards. The pot is already at 26, and raising will help build the pot while also putting pressure on my opponent. Given the stack sizes, raising to the minimum allows me to stay in the game while also giving me a chance to take control of the betting.

Stacks: P0=386, P1=384
With an Ace and a Four of Hearts, I have a decent starting hand, especially given that they are suited. Raising to the minimum of 18 will not only put pressure on my opponent but will also allow me to potentially take control of the pot while building it up. The current pot is already 30, and a raise could help me gain a stronger position heading into the next 
street.

Stacks: P0=382, P1=384
Raising to 20 puts pressure on the opponents and allows me to take control of the hand with a strong starting hand of Qc 
and 3c. Since I have a suited connector, there is potential for making a flush or straight. Additionally, with a pot of 34, raising will increase my expected value by potentially forcing weaker hands to fold or building the pot if I hit well 
on the flop.

Stacks: P0=382, P1=380
I have a strong starting hand with Ace of Hearts and Four of Hearts. Raising to 22 allows me to apply pressure on my opponent while still maintaining a reasonable stack size. Given the current pot and the action so far, this is a good opportunity to take control of the hand.
Action: CompletionBettingOrRaisingTo(commentary=None, player_index=0, amount=22)
Stacks: P0=378, P1=380
Given my hole cards of Qc and 3c, I have a queen high hand which is relatively strong for a pre-flop situation, especially with no significant raises from opponents. The pot is already at 42, and calling the 2 allows me to see the flop without risking too much of my stack. Raising could potentially scare off weaker hands and I prefer to see how the flop develops before committing more chips.

  warn(message)
I have a strong hand with a pair of fours (4h and 4s) and I'm currently ahead on this flop. Additionally, with the pot already at 44 and my opponent likely to continue playing, a small raise of 2 could extract value while also giving me the chance to potentially take control of the hand.

Stacks: P0=376, P1=378
Considering the current board and my hole cards, I have a weak hand with only a 3-high straight draw. The pot is relatively small at 46, and the opponent has been aggressive with multiple raises, indicating they may have a stronger hand. With only 2 to call, it makes sense to see the next card without committing more chips, especially since I still have the potential to improve my hand on the turn.

Stacks: P0=376, P1=376
I have a strong hand with a pair of fours (4h and 4s) and a potential for improvement with the current board. Raising helps build the pot and puts pressure on my opponent, while also protecting my hand against draws. The minimal raise amount of 2 keeps me in the game without risking too much of my stack.

Given the current board and my hole cards, I have a potential straight draw with the 3c and Qc. The pot is currently 50, and the cost to call is only 2. This is a favorable situation to see the river for a minimal investment, allowing me to evaluate my chances of completing a strong hand.

With a strong hand consisting of Ace of Hearts and Four of Hearts, I have two pairs (Aces and Fours). The pot is currently at 52, and I have a good opportunity to extract value from my strong hand by making a small raise to 2. This move can potentially induce a call from my opponent, increasing my winnings without risking much of my stack.

Stacks: P0=372, P1=374
Given the board and my hole cards, I currently have a Queen high which is not a strong hand. However, there is a small amount to call (only 2 chips) compared to the pot (54 chips), making it a favorable situation to see the outcome. I will call the 2 chips and see if my hand holds up against my opponent's.
