# All-In Player Implementation

## Overview

The All-In player is a specialized poker agent that always goes all-in on every hand, regardless of the game state, cards, or situation. This player serves as a baseline for testing and comparison with more sophisticated AI players.

## Features

- **Always All-In**: Goes all-in whenever possible (raises to full stack)
- **Fallback Actions**: When all-in is not possible, calls bets or checks
- **Full Integration**: Compatible with the existing player factory and game system
- **Performance Tracking**: Maintains hand history, statistics, and notes like other players
- **No API Dependencies**: Works without requiring any external API keys

## Usage

### Basic Creation

```python
from player import Player
from players.player_factory import PlayerFactory

# Method 1: Using the Player wrapper
all_in_player = Player("AllInBot", "all-in", "all-in-bot", initial_stack=400)

# Method 2: Using the factory directly
all_in_player = PlayerFactory.create_all_in_player("AllInBot", initial_stack=400)

# Method 3: Using the generic factory method
all_in_player = PlayerFactory.create_player("AllInBot", "all-in", initial_stack=400)
```

### Game Integration

The All-In player can be used in the main game orchestrator:

```python
from test import Orchestrator

# Create an orchestrator with an All-In player
orch = Orchestrator(hands=10)
orch.players = [
    Player("AllInBot", "all-in", "all-in-bot", initial_stack=400),
    Player("Mr.Claude", "anthropic", "claude-3-5-haiku-latest", initial_stack=400)
]

# Run the game
asyncio.run(orch.run())
```

## Behavior

### Decision Logic

The All-In player follows this decision hierarchy:

1. **Raise All-In**: If raising is possible, raises to the full stack
2. **Call**: If facing a bet and cannot raise, calls the bet
3. **Check**: If no bet to call, checks

### Response Format

The player returns responses in the standard format:
```
<action>@<reason>
```

Examples:
- `raise_to: 400@Going all-in with 400 chips!`
- `call@Going all-in by calling 200`
- `check@Going all-in by checking (no bet to call)`

## Implementation Details

### Class Structure

```python
class AllInPlayer(BasePlayer):
    """All-In player that always goes all-in on every hand."""
    
    def __init__(self, name: str, model: str = "all-in-bot", 
                 initial_stack: int = 400, system_prompt: str = None):
        # Inherits from BasePlayer
        
    async def _chat(self, messages: Sequence[Dict[str, str]]) -> str:
        # Override to generate all-in responses
        
    def _extract_game_state(self, messages: Sequence[Dict[str, str]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Extract game state from messages
        
    def _generate_all_in_response(self, game_state: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        # Generate appropriate all-in response
        
    async def make_decision(self, game_state: Dict[str, Any], legal_actions: List[str]) -> str:
        # Override to bypass LLM communication
```

### Key Methods

- **`_generate_all_in_response()`**: Core logic for determining the all-in action
- **`make_decision()`**: Override that bypasses LLM communication for speed
- **`_extract_game_state()`**: Parses game state from conversation messages

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run the basic test suite
python run_all_in_tests.py

# Run the example
python example_all_in_player.py

# Run integration test
python test_all_in_integration.py
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
- ✅ Basic player creation and initialization
- ✅ Response generation for different scenarios
- ✅ Async functionality and decision making
- ✅ Factory integration and validation
- ✅ Player features (stack updates, memory, notes, metrics)
- ✅ Integration with the game system

## Factory Integration

The All-In player is fully integrated into the PlayerFactory:

```python
# Supported providers now include "all-in"
PlayerFactory.get_supported_providers()
# ['openai', 'gemini', 'anthropic', 'all-in']

# Supported models for all-in provider
PlayerFactory.get_supported_models("all-in")
# ['all-in-bot']

# Convenience method
PlayerFactory.create_all_in_player("Bot", initial_stack=400)
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Speed
- **Decision Time**: ~0.000s (instantaneous, no API calls)
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal (no LLM context storage)
- **Reliability**: 100% (no network dependencies)

### Strategy
- **VPIP**: 100% (voluntarily puts money in every hand)
- **PFR**: 100% (raises preflop in every hand where possible)
- **Aggression**: Maximum (always bets/raises when possible)

## Use Cases

### 1. Baseline Testing
Use as a control player to test other AI strategies:
```python
# Compare sophisticated AI vs All-In baseline
orch.players = [
    Player("GPT4", "openai", "gpt-4o", initial_stack=400),
    Player("AllInBaseline", "all-in", "all-in-bot", initial_stack=400)
]
```

### 2. System Validation
Test game mechanics and edge cases:
```python
# Test system with predictable player
orch.players = [
    Player("AllInTest", "all-in", "all-in-bot", initial_stack=400),
    Player("AllInTest2", "all-in", "all-in-bot", initial_stack=400)
]
```

### 3. Performance Benchmarking
Measure system performance without API costs:
```python
# Fast, free testing of game logic
orch = Orchestrator(hands=1000)  # Can run many hands quickly
```

## Limitations

1. **Predictable**: Always goes all-in, making it easy to exploit
2. **No Adaptation**: Doesn't learn or adjust strategy
3. **No Bluffing**: Always shows strength, never bluffs
4. **Poor Long-term Performance**: Will lose money against skilled opponents

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the All-In player:
- **Randomization**: Add some randomness to make it less predictable
- **Position Awareness**: Adjust strategy based on position
- **Stack Size Awareness**: Modify behavior based on stack depth
- **Opponent Modeling**: Track and exploit opponent tendencies

## Files Created

- ✅ Extends `BasePlayer` class
- ✅ Works with `PlayerFactory`
- ✅ Compatible with `Player` wrapper
- ✅ Integrates with game orchestrator
- ✅ Maintains conversation history
- ✅ Supports notes and memory features
